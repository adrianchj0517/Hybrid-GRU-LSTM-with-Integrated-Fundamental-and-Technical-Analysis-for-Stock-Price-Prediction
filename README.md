Hybrid GRU-LSTM with Integrated Fundamental and Technical Analysis for Stock Price Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a Hybrid GRU-LSTM model that integrates fundamental and technical analysis to enhance stock price prediction accuracy. By combining Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the model captures both short-term patterns and long-term dependencies in stock market data.

ðŸ”¥ Features
Hybrid GRU-LSTM Model: Utilizes the strengths of both GRU and LSTM for sequential stock market prediction.
Fundamental & Technical Analysis: Incorporates key financial ratios (P/E, EPS, etc.) and technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.).
Deep Learning Implementation: Built using TensorFlow/Keras.
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, feature selection, and normalization.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates predictions using MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² scores.
Backtesting & Benchmarking: Compares results with traditional stock prediction models.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Preparation
Use stock market datasets with fundamental indicators (e.g., revenue, net income) and technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI).
Format the dataset as a CSV file with timestamps, open, high, low, close prices, and indicators.
Store the dataset in the data/ directory.

ðŸ“ˆ Model Architecture
The model consists of:

GRU Layer: Captures short-term dependencies in stock price movements.
LSTM Layer: Captures long-term trends and avoids vanishing gradient issues.
Dense Layers: Outputs the final stock price prediction.
ðŸ“‘ Results
The model is evaluated using:
âœ” Mean Squared Error (MSE)
âœ” Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
âœ” R-squared Score (RÂ²)
